# Cranberry Weird Stuff

### Crust Layer
Ingredients:
- 2 cups crushed Ritz crackers
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
    - if you wanna be fancy, make a bur monte sauce and make sure to bake the base layer enough to make it crispy
    - the extra creaminess of the butter helps it distribute much "butter" (get it?)
    - should try this without the bur monte as well
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup toffee bits
    - these are impossible to find, use butterscotch bits instead if needed
- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine everything. Mix until the crumbs are evenly moistened.
    - I swear to god, you have to use a separate mixing bowl AND you have to grease the pan. It's impossible to get this shit out of the pan if it's not greased
3. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of a *greased* 9x13-inch baking dish.
4. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until slightly golden. Allow to cool while you prepare the next layer.
    - Really gotta bake for longer than this if you want the base to hold together more and be crispy

### Cream Cheese Layer
Ingredients:
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
    - like really soft. You want that shit basically melting so that it does stay globby at the end
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream (or use 1 cup of pre-whipped topping)

Instructions:
1. In a bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until smooth.
2. In another bowl, whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
3. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until uniformly mixed.
4. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the cooled crust. Refrigerate while you prepare the cranberry compote.

### Cranberry Compote Topping
Ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh cranberries
    - can use other berries as well, the more tart the better
    - did really well with dark cherries
    - add lemon juice for extra tartness
    - added the juice of two limes once and it wasn't bad at all
    - could potentially double this, the compote typically doesn't spread very evenly for the pan size recommended
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 1/2 cup sugar (adjust based on your preference for sweetness)
- Zest of one orange

Instructions:
1. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine cranberries, orange juice, sugar, and orange zest.
2. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the mixture thickens, about 10-15 minutes.
3. Allow to cool slightly, then pour over the cream cheese layer.
4. Refrigerate the dessert for at least 4 hours, or overnight, until set.

Feel free to adjust the amounts of the ingredients based on your taste preferences and the size of your dish. This dessert combines a delightful mix of textures and flavors, from the crunchy, sweet base to the creamy middle and the tangy, fruity top. Enjoy your creation!
